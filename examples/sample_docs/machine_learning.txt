Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised. Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.
