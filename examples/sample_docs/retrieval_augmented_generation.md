# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources. In simple terms, RAG is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process.

## How RAG Works

RAG combines the power of retrieval-based and generative AI models:

1. **Retrieval Phase** : When a query is received, the system searches a knowledge base or document collection to find relevant information.
2. **Augmentation Phase** : The retrieved information is added to the original query as context.
3. **Generation Phase** : The augmented prompt is fed to a language model, which generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context.

## Benefits of RAG

* **Reduced Hallucination** : By grounding responses in retrieved facts, RAG significantly reduces the likelihood of AI hallucination.
* **Up-to-date Information** : RAG can access current information beyond the training cutoff of the base model.
* **Domain Specificity** : Organizations can use RAG with their proprietary data without retraining models.
* **Transparency** : RAG systems can cite sources, making it easier to verify the information.

## Common Use Cases

* Question answering systems
* Customer support chatbots
* Research assistants
* Documentation search
* Legal and medical information retrieval
