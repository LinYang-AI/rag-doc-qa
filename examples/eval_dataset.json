      "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. While machine learning encompasses various techniques for learning from data, deep learning specifically uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.",

      "answer": "RAG provides several benefits: reduced hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved facts, access to up-to-date information beyond the training cutoff, domain specificity without retraining models, and transparency through source citations.",

      "query": "What are supervised and unsupervised machine learning?",
      "relevant_docs": ["machine_learning.txt"],
      "answer": "Supervised machine learning algorithms use labeled examples to predict future events by applying what has been learned to new data. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the training information is neither classified nor labeled.",
